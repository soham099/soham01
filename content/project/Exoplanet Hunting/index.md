An Exoplanet or Extrasolar planet is an earth-like planet outside the Solar System. The Kepler Space Observatory has analyzed 10000 odd *Kepler Object of Interests*, and designated them either *Exoplanet*, or *False Positive*. This designation follows complex mathematical formulae that's not open to public. We try to emulate Kepler's analysis using simple statistical tools that also gives us interpretability.
